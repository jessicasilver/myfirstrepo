## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Q2 Read in car dataset
First, read in `cars` dataset. 
Next, define new new values for `speed` and `dist`. 

```{r cars, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
speed <- cars$speed
dist <- cars$dist
```

##Building the speed x dist plot

We have defined `speed` and `dist`
We can eyeball the data using the `plot` function.
Following this, we can create a new data name for the linear regression model. This has been named `lm_cars`. 
Have a look at the output using the `summary()` function. 


```{r cars}
plot(x=speed, y=dist)
lm_cars <- lm(dist ~ speed)
summary(lm_cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
